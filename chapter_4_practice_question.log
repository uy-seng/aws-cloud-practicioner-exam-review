launch into the currently selected value of which of the following?
A. Service
B. Subnet
C. Availability zone
D. Region

Answer: D. ec2 instances will automatically launch into the region you currently have selected.

4. Which of the following are not globally based AWS services? (Choose two.)
A. RDS
B. Route 53
C. EC2
D. CloudFront

Answer: A, C. rds and ec2 both use resources that can exist in on

a particular Relational Database Service instance you’re running in the Northern
Virginia region?
A. us-east-1.amazonaws.com.rds
B. ecs.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com
C. rds.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
D. rds.amazonaws.com.us-east-1

Answer: C. service endpoint follow a specific format that include service name and region

6. What are the most significant architectural benefits of the way AWS designed its regions?
(Choose two.)
A. It can make infrastructure more fault-tolerant.
B. It can make applications available to end users with lower latency.
C. It can make applications more compliant with local regulations.
D. It can bring down the price of running.

Answer: A, B. aws regions are designed with multiple availbaility zone, which mean if one zone fail, service can continue running in others. having aws region
distributed globally allows applications to be hosted closer to end user, reducing latency and improving performance.

7. Why is it that most AWS resources are tied to a single region?
A. Because those resources are run on a physical device, and that device must live
somewhere
B. Because security considerations are best served by restricting access to a single
physical location
C. Because access to any one digital resource must always occur through a single
physical gateway
D. Because spreading them too far afield would introduce latency issues

Answer: A.

8. You want to improve the resilience of your EC2 web server. Which of the following is the
most effective and efficient approach?
A. Launch parallel, load-balanced
instances in multiple AWS regions.
B. Launch parallel, load-balanced
instances in multiple availability zones within a single
AWS region.
C. Launch parallel, autoscaled instances in multiple AWS regions.
D. Launch parallel, autoscaled instances in multiple availability zones within a single
AWS region.

Answer: B. multiple azs within a single region offer the most efficient and effective apporach to improving resiliences. if one az fails, your instances
in other azs can continue to operate, and using a load balancer ensures traffic is distributed across healthy instances.

9. Which of the following is the most accurate description of an AWS availability zone?
A. One or more independently powered data centers running a wide range of hardware
host types
B. One or more independently powered data centers running a uniform hardware host type
C. All the data centers located within a broad geographic area
D. The infrastructure running within a single physical data center

Answer: A. an az consists of one or more data centers that are independently powered and networked to provide fault isolation. these data centers
can run a variety of hardware types to support diverse workloads and ensure resilience.

10. Which of the following most accurately describes a subnet within the AWS ecosystem?
A. The virtual limits imposed on the network access permitted to a resource instance
B. The block of IP addresses assigned for use within a single region
C. The block of IP addresses assigned for use within a single availability zone
D. The networking hardware used within a single availability zone

Answer: C. a subnet in aws is a range of ip addresses in your vpc. subnets are typically associate with a single availability zone to siolate resources
for fault tolerance and scalability within that zone.

11. What determines the order by which subnets/AZ options are displayed in EC2 configuration
dialog boxes?
A. Alphabetical order.
B. They (appear) to be displayed in random order.
C. Numerical order.
D. By order of capacity, with largest capacity first.

Answer: B.

12. What is the primary goal of autoscaling?
A. To ensure the long-term
reliability of a particular physical resource
B. To ensure the long-term
reliability of a particular virtual resource
C. To orchestrate the use of multiple parallel resources to direct incoming user requests
D. To ensure that a predefined service level is maintained regardless of external demand or
instance failures

Answer: D. autosacling is designed to automatically adjust the number of running instannces based on demand and predefined conditions. it ensures that your
application maintains a consistent performance level even as demand fluctuates or instance fail, by adding or removing resouces as needed.

13. Which of the following design strategies is most effective for maintaining the reliability of a
cloud application?
A. Resource isolation
B. Resource automation
C. Resource redundancy
D. Resource geolocation

Answer: C. resource redundancy is the mosst effective strategy for maintaining the reliability of a cloud application by having multiple instances
of resources (like servers, databases, etc.), you ensure that if one resource fails, others can take over, minimizing downtime and improving reliability.

14. Which of the following AWS services are not likely to benefit from Amazon edge locations?
(Choose two.)
A. RDS
B. EC2 load balancers
C. Elastic Block Store (EBS)
D. CloudFront

Answer: A. C. rds and ebs are not typically associated with amazon edge locations. these services are more focused on storing and managing data within
specific region or azs, and they do not benefit from edge location designed for content delivery and caching.

15. Which of the following is the primary benefit of using CloudFront distributions?
A. Automated protection from mass email campaigns
B. Greater availability through redundancy
C. Greater security through data encryption
D. Reduced latency access to your content no matter where your end users live

Answer: D.

16. What is the main purpose of Amazon Route 53?
A. Countering the threat of distributed denial-of-
service
(DDoS) attacks
B. Managing domain name registration and traffic routing
C. Protecting web applications from web-based
threats
D. Using the serverless power of Lambda to customize CloudFront behavior

Answer: B.

17. According to the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, which of the following are responsibilities
of AWS? (Choose two.)
A. The security of the cloud
B. Patching underlying virtualization software running in AWS data centers
C. Security of what’s in the cloud
D. Patching OSs running on EC2 instances

Answer: A. B. aws is responsible for securing the infra that runs all of the service offered in the aws cloud, including software netwokring and 
facilities. aws manages and patches the underlying virtualization layer and physical servers in its data center.

18. According to the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, what’s the best way to define the status
of the software driving an AWS managed service?
A. Everything associated with an AWS managed service is the responsibility of AWS.
B. Whatever is added by the customer (like application code) is the customer’s
responsibility.
C. Whatever the customer can control (application code and/or configuration settings) is
the customer’s responsibility.
D. Everything associated with an AWS managed service is the responsibility of the customer.

Answer: C. in aws shared responsibility model, aws is responsible for managing the undelrying infra, including the hardware network and software that drives
managed services. however, customers are responsible for anything they can control, such as applicaiton code, config settings and data within those
services.

19. Which of the following is one of the first places you should look when troubleshooting a
failing application?
A. AWS Acceptable Use Monitor
B. Service Status Dashboard
C. AWS Billing Dashboard
D. Service Health Dashboard

Answer: D. the service health dahsboard provides real-time info about the status of aws services. if your app is failing, checking this dashboard will help
determine if there is an ongoing issue with any of the aws services that could be impacting your application

20. Where will you find information on the limits AWS imposes on the ways you can use your
account resources?
A. AWS User Agreement Policy
B. AWS Acceptable Use Policy
C. AWS Acceptable Use Monitor
D. AWS Acceptable Use Dashboard

Answer: B. the aws acceptable use policy outlines rules and limitations regarding how you can use aws services and resources. it defines prohibited activities,
such as illegal or harmful use of aws services.

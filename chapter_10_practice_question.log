Answer: A. a vpc or subnet CIDR can have a size between /16 and /28, inclusive

3. Which of the following are true regarding subnets? (Choose two.)
A. A VPC must have at least two subnets.
B. A subnet must have a CIDR that’s a subset of the CIDR of the VPC in which it resides.
C. A subnet spans one availability zone.
D. A subnet spans multiple availability zones.

Answer: B, C. a subnet exist only in 1 availability zone, and it must have a CIDR that's a subnet of CIDR of the vpc 
in which it resides. theres not requirement for a vpc to have two subnets but it must have at least one.

4. Which of the following is true of a new security group?
A. It contains an inbound rule denying access from public IP addresses.
B. It contains an outbound rule denying access to public IP addresses.
C. It contains an outbound rule allowing access to any IP address.
D. It contains an inbound rule allowing access from any IP address.
E. It contains an inbound rule denying access from any IP address.

Answer: C. when you create a security group, it contains an outbound rule that allows access to any ip address 
it doesn't contain an inbound role by default. security group rules can only permit access, not deny it, 
so any traffic not explicity

5. What’s the difference between a security group and a network access control list (NACL)?
(Choose two.)
A. A network access control list operates at the instance level.
B. A security group operates at the instance level.
C. A security group operates at the subnet level.
D. A network access control list operates at the subnet level.

Answer: B, D. a network acl is a firewall that operates at a subnet level. a security gorup is a firewall that operate at the
instance level.

6. Which of the following is true of a VPC peering connection?
A. It’s a private connection that connects more than three VPCs.
B. It’s a private connection between two VPCs.
C. It’s a public connection between two VPCs.
D. It’s a virtual private network (VPN) connection between two VPCs.

Answer: B. a vpc peering connection is a private connect only between two vpc.

7. What are two differences between a virtual private network (VPN) connection and a Direct
Connect connection? (Choose two.)
A. A Direct Connect connection offers predictable latency because it doesn’t traverse the
Internet.
B. A VPN connection uses the Internet for transport.
C. A Direct Connect connection uses AES 128-or
256-bit
encryption.
D. A VPN connection requires proprietary hardware.

Answer: A, B. a direct ocnnect link uses a dedicated link rather than the internet to privde predictable latency. direct connect does
not use encryption but provides some security by means of a private link. a vpn connection uses the internet for transport, encrypting
data with aes 128 or 256 bit encryption. a vpn connection does not require proprierty hardware.

8. Which of the following are true about registering a domain name with Route 53?
(Choose two.)
A. The registrar you use to register a domain name determines who will host DNS for
that domain.
B. You can register a domain name for a term of up to 10 years.
C. Route 53 creates a private hosted zone for the domain.
D. Route 53 creates a public hosted zone for the domain.

Answer: B, D. when you register a domain name, you can choose a temr between 1 year and 10 years. if you use route 53, it will
automatically create a public hosted zone for the domain. the registrar and dns hosting provideer does not have to have the same entity,
but often are.

9. Which of the following Route 53 routing policies can return a set of randomly
ordered values?
A. Simple
B. Multivalue Answer
C. Failover
D. Latency

Answer: B. a multivalue answer routing policy can return a set of multiple values, sorted randomly. a simple routing policy
return a single value. a failover routing policy always routes user to the primary resource unless it's down, in which case it routes
user to the seconadry resource. a latency routing policy sends user to the resource in the aws region that provides the least 
latency.

10. Which of the following Route 53 routing policies doesn’t use health checks?
A. Latency
B. Multivalue Answer
C. Simple
D. Geolocation

Answer: C. all route 53 routing policies except for simple can use health checks,

11. Which of the following types of Route 53 health checks works by making a test connection
to a TCP port?
A. Simple
B. CloudWatch alarm
C. Endpoint
D. Calculated

Answer: C. an endpoint health check works by connecting to monitored endpoint via HTTP, HTTPS or TCP.

12. You have two EC2 instances hosting a web application. You want to distribute 20 percent of
traffic to one instance and 80 percent to the other. Which of the following Route 53 routing
policies should you use?
A. Weighted
B. Failover
C. Multivalue Answer
D. Simple

Answer: A. a weighted routing policy lets you distribute traffic to endpoints according to a radio that you define. none of the other 
routing policies allows this.

13. Resources in a VPC need to be able to resolve internal IP addresses for other resources in the
VPC. No one outside of the VPC should be able to resolve these addresses. Which of the following
Route 53 resources can help you achieve this?
A. A public hosted zone
B. A private hosted zone
C. Domain name registration
D. Health checks

Answer: B. a private hosted zone is associated with a vpc and allows resoures in the vpc to resolve private domain names.
a public hosted zone is accessible by anyone on the internet. domain name registration is for public domain names. health checks
aren't necessary for name resolution to work.

14. You want to provide private name resolution for two VPCs using the domain name
company.pri. How many private hosted zones do you need to create?
A. 1
B. 2
C. 3
D. 4

Answer: A. route 53 private hosteds zone provide DNS resolutions for a single domian name within multiple vpcs. therefore, to support
resolution of one domain name for two vpcs, you would need one private hosted zone.

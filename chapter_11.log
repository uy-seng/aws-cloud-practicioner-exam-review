automation in aws:
    aws offers many ways to automate tasks, with the choice of service depending on your architecture.

automation as code:
    tasks are automated by writing code that the system runs.

    imperative approach
        specifies exact steps to perform a task, like bash or powershell scripts. examples include aws system amanger, codebuild
        codedeploy and ec2 auto-scaling userdata scripts

    declarative approach: 
        specifies the desired outcome, and the service figures out the steps to achieve it. examples include cloudformation, opsworks
        for puppet and chef, and opsworks stacks.


imperative vs declarative
    they are ot opposite, declarative approach hides the step-by-step details, focusing on result.
    while the iperative appoarch spells out the specific step

config management   
    focuses on ensuring configuration consistency and compliance.

    declarative platform:
        puppet and chef focus on maintaining a desired state using declarative language.

    imperative pplatform:
        aws system amanger also provides configuration management but uses an imperative approach.

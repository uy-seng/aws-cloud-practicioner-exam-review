ec2 setup
    configuring ec2 instances is similar to setting up traditional pn-remises servers. key choices include amis (machine image),
    instance tyes, storage and pricing models.

ami (amazon machine image)
    four categories, quick start, my ami (custom), aws marketplace, and community. you can also create your own ami from an
    ebs snapshot.

ec2 instance types:
    different types are desinged for specific application needs, with various sizes to optimize performance.

ebs storage volumes:
    like physical hard drives, flexible and ce be encrypted, instance store volumes offer faster performance but are 
    tied to physical server

ec2 pricing models:
    on-demand: good for short-term tasks that cant be interrupted.
    reserved instances: best for long-term work load and cheaper over time
    spot instances: ideal for data operations can can handle unexpected shutdowns and interruptions

abstracted computer services:
    tools like lightsial, elastic beanstalk, ecs, eks and lambda simplify and automate compute tasks while reducing costs.

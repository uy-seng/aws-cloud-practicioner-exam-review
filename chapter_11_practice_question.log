1. Which of the following is an advantage of using CloudFormation?
A. It uses the popular Python programming language.
B. It prevents unauthorized manual changes to resources.
C. It lets you create multiple separate AWS environments using a single template.
D. It can create resources outside of AWS.

Answer: C. cloudformation can create aws resources and manages them collectively in a stack. templates are written in cloudformation
language not python. cloudformation cannot create resources outside of aws. it also does not prevent manual changes to resources in 
a stack

2. What formats do CloudFormation templates support? (Choose two.)
A. XML
B. YAML
C. HTML
D. JSON

Answer: B, D. cloudformation template are written in yaml or json.

3. What’s an advantage of using parameters in a CloudFormation template?
A. Allow customizing a stack without changing the template.
B. Prevent unauthorized users from using a template.
C. Prevent stack updates.
D. Allow multiple stacks to be created from the same template.

Answer: A. parameters let you input customization when creating cloudformation stack without having to modify the underlying 
template.

4. Why would you use CloudFormation to automatically create resources for a development
environment instead of creating them using AWS CLI commands? (Choose two.)
A. The resources CloudFormation creates are organized into stacks and can be managed as
a single unit.
B. CloudFormation stack updates help ensure that changes to one resource won’t break
another.
C. Resources created by CloudFormation always work as expected.
D. CloudFormation can provision resources faster than the AWS CLI.

Answer: A, B. the resources clooudformation creates are organized into stacks. when you update a stack, cloufronation analyze
the relationship among resources in teh stack and updates dependent resources as necessary. this does not, however, mean that any
resouces you create using cloudformation will work as you expect.

5. What are two features of CodeCommit? (Choose two.)
A. Versioning
B. Automatic deployment
C. Differencing
D. Manual deployment

Answer: A, C. codecommit is a private git repository that offers versioning and differencing. it does not perform deployments.

6. In the context of CodeCommit, what can differencing accomplish?
A. Allowing reverting to an older version of a file
B. Understanding what code change introduced a bug
C. Deleting duplicate lines of code
D. Seeing when an application was last deployed

Asnwer: B. differencing let you see the differences between two version of a file which can be useful when figuring out what change introduced
a bug.

7. What software development practice regularly tests new code for bugs but doesn’t do
anything else?
A. Differencing
B. Continuous deployment
C. Continuous delivery
D. Continuous integration

Answer: D. continuous integration is the pratice of running code through a build or test process as soon as it's checked into a repository.
continous delovery and continous deployment include continous integration but add deployment to the process.

Answer: A, B, C. codedeploy can deploy application files to linux or windows ec2 instances and docker containers to ecs. it cannot
deploy an applicationn to smartphones and it cannot deploy files to an s3 bucket.

11. What is the minimum number of actions in a CodePipeline pipeline?
A. 1
B. 2
C. 3
D. 4
E. 0

Answer: B. at the very leaast, a code pipeline must consist of a source stage and a deploy stage.

creates? (Choose two.)
A. Maximum
B. Group size
C. Desired capacity
D. Minimum

Anser: A, D. the maximum groupsize and minimum gorup size values limit the number of instances of an auto scaling group.

14. An Auto Scaling group has a desired capacity of 7 and a maximum size of 7. What will Auto
Scaling do if someone manually terminates one of these instances?
A. It will not launch any new instances.
B. It will launch one new instance.
C. It will terminate one instance.
D. It will change the desired capacity to 6.

Answer:  B. autosacling will use self-healing to replace the failed instance to maintain the desired capactiy of 7.

A. Predictive scaling
B. Scheduled scaling
C. Dynamic scaling
D. Pattern scaling

Answer: A. predictive scaling creates a scheduled scaling action based on past usage pattern.

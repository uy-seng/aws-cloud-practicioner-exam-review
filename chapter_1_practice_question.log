1. Which of the following does not contribute significantly to the operational value of a large cloud provider like AWS?
A. Multiregional presence
B. Highly experienced teams of security engineers
C. Deep experience in the retail sphere
D. Metered, pay-per-use pricing

Answer: C

2. Which of the following are signs of a highly available application? (Choose two.)
A. A failure in one geographic region will trigger an automatic failover to resources in a
different region.
B. Applications are protected behind multiple layers of security.
C. Virtualized hypervisor-driven
systems are deployed as mandated by company policy.
D. Spikes in user demand are met through automatically increasing resources.

Answer: A,D

3. How does the metered payment model make many benefits of cloud computing possible?
(Choose two.)
A. Greater application security is now possible.
B. Experiments with multiple configuration options are now cost-effective.
C. Applications are now highly scalable.
D. Full-stack applications are possible without the need to invest in capital expenses.

Answer: B, D

4. Which of the following are direct benefits of server virtualization? (Choose two.)
A. Fast resource provisioning and launching
B. Efficient (high-density) use of resources
C. Greater application security
D. Elastic application designs

Answer: A, B
note: server virtualization aloow resources to be quickly created and deployed leading to faster provisioning. 
virtualization enable multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server, maximizing the use of hardware resouces efficiently

5. What is a hypervisor?
A. Hardware device used to provide an interface between storage and compute modules
B. Hardware device used to provide an interface between networking and compute modules
C. Software used to log and monitor virtualized operations
D. Software used to administer virtualized resources run on physical infrastructure

Answer: D. it is a type of software that allow multiple vms to run on a single physical machine by managing the virtualized resources. it provides
an interface between the hardware and the vms ensuring that each vm operates independently while sharing the underlying physical resources.

6. Which of the following best describes server virtualization?
A. “Sharding” data from multiple sources into a single virtual data store
B. Logically partitioning physical compute and storage devices into multiple smaller
virtual devices
C. Aggregating physical resources spread over multiple physical devices into a single
virtual device
D. Abstracting the complexity of physical infrastructure behind a simple web interface

Answer: B

7. Which of the following best describes infrastructure-as-a-service products?
A. Services that hide infrastructure complexity behind a simple interface
B. Services that provide a service to end users through a public network
C. Services that give you direct control over underlying compute and storage resources
D. Platforms that allow developers to run their code over short periods on cloud servers

Answer: C.

8. Which of the following best describes platform-as-a-service products?

B. Platforms that allow developers to run their code over short periods on cloud servers
C. Services that give you direct control over underlying compute and storage resources
D. Services that provide a service to end users through a public network

Answer: A.

10. Which of the following best describes scalability?
A. The ability of an application to automatically add preconfigured compute resources to
meet increasing demand
B. The ability of an application to increase or decrease compute resources to match changing
demand
C. The ability to more densely pack virtualized resources onto a single physical server
D. The ability to bill resource usage using a pay-per-user model

Answer: A. increasing or decreasing compuing resources better describes elasticity.

B. In addition to an access password, users also authenticate via a physical MFA device.
C. Users authenticate using tokens sent to at least two MFA devices.

5. Which of the following SSH commands will successfully connect to an EC2 Amazon Linux
instance with an IP address of 54.7.35.103 using a key named mykey.pem?
A. echo "mykey.pem ubuntu@54.7.35.103" | ssh -i

B. Assign users requiring similar permissions to IAM groups.
C. Assign IAM users permissions common to others with similar administration
responsibilities.

Answer: A, D. federated identities are for permitting authenticated entities access to aws resources and data. they are not for importing anything from external accounts - neither data
nor guidance.

day
administration tasks?
A. AdministratorAccess
B. AmazonS3FullAccess
C. AmazonEC2FullAccess
D. AdminAccess

id alone without matching secret access key is worthless.

Amazon S3?
A. DynamoDB
B. SSE-S3
C. A client-side master key
D. SSE-KMS

S3 bucket. dynamodb is no sql database service.

16. Which of the following AWS resources cannot be encrypted using KMS?
A. Existing AWS Elastic Block Store volumes

19. What is the purpose of the Service Organization Controls (SOC) reports found on AWS
Artifact?
A. They can be used to help you design secure and reliable credit card transaction
applications.
B. They attest to AWS infrastructure compliance with data accountability standards like
Sarbanes–Oxley.
C. They guarantee that all AWS-based
applications are, by default, compliant with
Sarbanes–Oxley standards.
D. They’re an official, ongoing risk-assessment
profiler for AWS-based
deployments.

Answer: B. soc isnt primarily about guidance or risk assessment, and its definitely not a gurantee of the state of your own deployments. soc reports are reports of audits on aws
infra that you can use as part of your own reporting requirements.

Answer: A, B. aws artifact documents are about aws infra compliance with external standards. they trangentially can also provide insight into best practices. they do not represent
internal aws design or policies.

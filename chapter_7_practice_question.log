1. What is the function of an EC2 AMI?
A. To define the hardware profile used by an EC2 instance
B. To serve as an instance storage volume for high-volume
data processing operations
C. To serve as a source image from which an instance’s primary storage volume is built
D. To define the way data streams are managed by EC2 instances

Answer: C. an instance's hardware profile is defined by instance type. high-volume data processing operations and data streams can be handled using any
storage volume or on any instance.

2. Where can you find a wide range of verified AMIs from both AWS and third-party
vendors?
A. AWS Marketplace
B. Quick Start
C. Community AMIs
D. My AMIs

Answer:  A. the quick start includes only a few dozen most popular amis. the community tab includes thousands of publicly
available amis - whether verified or not. the my amis tabs only includes amis created form your account.

3. Which of the following could be included in an EC2 AMI? (Choose two.)
A. A networking configuration
B. A software application stack
C. An operating system
D. An instance type definition

Answer: B, C. amis can be created that provide both a base os and a preinstalled applcatijn. they would not, however, include
any networking or hardware profile info

4. Which of the following are EC2 instance type families? (Choose two.)
A. c5d.18xlarge
B. Compute optimized
C. t2.micro
D. Accelerated computing

Answer: B, D. c5d.18xlarge and t2.micro are the names of ec2 instance types not instance type families.

5. When describing EC2 instance types, what is the role played by the vCPU metric?
A. vCPUs represent an instance’s potential resilience against external network demands.
B. vCPUs represent an instance type’s system memory compared to the class of memory
modules on a physical machine.
C. vCPUs represent an AMI’s processing power compared to the number of processors on a
physical machine.
D. vCPUs represent an instance type’s compute power compared to the number of processors
on a physical machine.

Answer: D. a vcpu is a metric that roughly measures an instant type's compute power in terms of number of processors on a physical
server.

6. Which of the following describes an EC2 dedicated instance?
A. An EC2 instance running on a physical host reserved for the exclusive use of a single
AWS account
B. An EC2 instance running on a physical host reserved for and controlled by a single
AWS account
C. An EC2 AMI that can be launched only on an instance within a single AWS account
D. An EC2 instance optimized for a particular compute role

Answer: A. ec2 instance that runs on physical host reserved for and controlled by a single aws account is called dedicated host.

7. Which of the following describes an EBS volume?
A. A software stack archive packaged to make it easy to copy and deploy to an EC2 instance
B. A virtualized partition of a physical storage drive that’s directly connected to the EC2
instance it’s associated with
C. A virtualized partition of a physical storage drive that’s not directly connected to the
EC2 instance it’s associated with
D. A storage volume that’s encrypted for greater security

Answer: C. a virtualized partition of physical storage that is directly connected to ec2 instance is known as instance store
volume.

8. Why might you want to use an instance store volume with your EC2 instance rather than a
volume from the more common EBS service? (Choose two.)
A. Instance store volumes can be encrypted.
B. Data on instance store volumes will survive an instance shutdown.
C. Instance store volumes provide faster data read/write performance.
D. Instance store volumes are connected directly to your EC2 instance.

Answer: C, D. instance store volumes cannot be encrypter nor will their data survive an instance shutdown. those are features of 
ebs volume

9. Your web application experiences periodic spikes in demand that require the provisioning of
extra instances. Which of the following pricing models would make the most sense for those
extra instances?
A. Spot
B. On-demand
C. Reserved
D. Dedicated

Answer: B. spot instances are unreliable for this sort of usage since they can be shutdown unexpectedly. reserved instances
make economic sense where they'll be used 24/7 ove rlong stretches of time.

10. Your web application experiences periodic spikes in demand that require the provisioning of
extra instances. Which of the following pricing models would make the most sense for the
“base” instances that will run constantly?
A. Spot
B. On-demand
C. Spot fleet
D. Reserved

Answer: D.  reserved instance will work here because your base instance will need to run 24/7 over the long term. spot and spot fleet
instances are unreliable for this sort of usage since they can be shut down unexpectedly. on-demand instances will incur unnecessarily high
costs over such a long period.

11. Which of the following best describes what happens when you purchase an EC2 reserved
instance?
A. Charges for any instances you run matching the reserved instance type will be covered
by the reservation.
B. Capacity matching the reserved definition will be guaranteed to be available whenever
you request it.
C. Your account will immediately and automatically be billed for the full reservation amount.
D. An EC2 instance matching your reservation will automatically be launched in the
selected AWS region.

Answer: A.

12. Which of the following use cases are good candidates for spot instances? (Choose two.)
A. Big data processing workloads
B. E-commerce
websites
C. Continuous integration development environments
D. Long-term,
highly available, content-rich
websites

Answer: A, C. spot instances can be shutdown they are not recommended for applications that provide any kind of always-on
service.

13. Which AWS services simplify the process of bringing web applications to deployment?
(Choose two.)
A. Elastic Block Store
B. Elastic Compute Cloud
C. Elastic Beanstalk
D. Lightsail


Answer: C. D. ebs provide storage volume for lgihtstail and beanstalk.

14. Which of the following services bills at a flat rate regardless of how it’s consumed?
A. Lightsail
B. Elastic Beanstalk
C. Elastic Compute Cloud
D. Relational Database Service

Answer: A. beanstalk, ec2, rds bill according to actual usage.

15. Which of these stacks are available from Lightsail blueprints? (Choose two.)
A. Ubuntu
B. Gitlab
C. WordPress
D. LAMP

Answer: B, D. ubuntu is an os, not a stack. wordpress is an applicaiton not an os

relational vs non relational db:
    if you are migrating an existing app, it likely uses a sql databases, you can choose between rds or setting up your own sql server in ec2.

new app development:
    deciding between relational and nonrelational databases isnt always easy. each has pros and cons`

relational db:
    designed for complex and varied queries
    requires structure data (organized in tables)
    great for reporting and analysis
    offer query flexibility, allowing searches on any attribute or range

nonrelational db:
    designed for fewer, well-defined queries
    can store structured or unstructured data
    ideal for highly transactional applications (handling many read/writes)
    less query flexibility compared to relational databases

scaling:
    nonrelational db:
        scale horizontally by spreading data accross partition supporting thousands of read/write per seconds

    relational db:
        can scale vertically for read (via read replicas) but for higher write rates , they need to scale vertically by upgrading to more powerful instances. only one instance can write
        to the database
